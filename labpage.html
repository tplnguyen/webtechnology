                        The communication consists of independent pairs of requests and responses. The advantage of this is that no information of a session from multiple users are saved.

                        A proxy ensures that more than one visitor can visit a page with the same ip-adres, they will be seen as the same visitor. Which means that the counter doesnt go up.</mark><br><br></dd>

                        HTML 4.01 is based on SGML. It is from 1999. Contrary to SGML, it is not possible for it to use of self defined tags.
                        XHTML 1.0 is based on XML. It is not really comparable with HTML 4.01. Some short cuts are for example not allowed in HTML 4.01.</mark><br><br></dd>

                        Though this process will increasing slower, you will continue to encouter new words till you have had all the words. Theoretically, when this happens the diagram will be horizontal at the end.</mark>

                        <dd><mark>To assess the quality of the TF-based search you have to look at the outcome. Words which are useful have a lower TF than stop words. The precision is the fraction of retrieved instances that are relevant,
                        while recall is the fraction of relevant instances that are retrieved. With the TF-based search you will know a lot more about the precision.</mark><br><br></dd>

                        <dd><mark>We looked up the video-sharing website <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a></u>. The site was founded by three employees of PayPal, Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim in February 2005. From the data on web.archive.org,
                        you can see that the site was not originally just a video-sharing website. Its orginal idea was a video version of an online dating service (see image beneath, from april 2005). The site stayed beta for next few months until the official launch in November 2005.
                        YouTube has now become one of the most visited sites, with more than 1 billion visitors each month.</mark><br><br>

                        <dd><mark>We used the site <a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/">Boredpanda.com</a>. The advertisement banner looks a lot like the menu, so to prevent any mistakes, we would put the advertisement banner in the footer. We realized that there wasn't even a menu tab. So we would add the menu tabs and make it very dynamic.
                        We would put a border around each word, so it will stand out more. It is a website for a magazine, so it is quite necessary to have a menu tab. With this, it will be easier for the users to find an article, because everything will be divided in clear sections. Our adjustments will be version A
                        and how the site is now will be version B. We are going to count everytime one of the menu tabs are clicked.</mark><br><br></dd>

                        They find this very important because undergraduate students aren't always capable to acquire the answers for their questions. 
                        The first point they discuss is to put the name of the university on every page, because not all the visitors arrive at the homepage. Second point is that it suggests to use images that will represent the university. 
                        Third point is that the 'About us' page should be short and clear. It should be written in simple language and state short facts. This will make it a lot less boring to read. 
                        Fourth fact is to highlight the strength and achievements of the university. Fifth fact is to make it easy to access all the majors and programs. 
                        Sixth fact is to link job placements after graduation to the associated major or program. Seventh point is to state all the deadlines clearly and to offer the visitors a step-by-step description of the application progress. 
                        Eight point is to check the user's journey. While doing this you will encounter duplicate, contradictory or missing information.
                        Nineth point is to use an age-appropriate language. This will be achieved by letting your students do the talking.
                        Last point is to check for information about the university on external sites. Because students who didn't find their answer will go to these external sites.
                        The <a href="http://www.vu.nl/nl/index.asp"> VU website </a> clearly abides to these guidelines.It has the name on every page, it uses images that represent the univesity.
                        It is easy to find the list with all the majors and programs. On these pages it is also possible to find the job opportunities after graduation. This site clearly implements these guidelines</mark><br><br></dd>

                        The year after the creation of W3C, Tim Berners-Lee made his first version of the Hyper Text Markup Language: HTML, this became the 'primary publishing format'.
                        He is also the first to use the terms: URL and HTTP. These terms were worked out by the users of the web.
                        W3C produced PNG, CSS and wrote HTML4.0, they also added a lot to XML to make it more accesible and easier to make.
                        They couldn't achieve this without working with companies as CERN, which helped with the basis of the World Wide Web.

                        <dd><mark>Spotify is a commercial music streaming service. The amount of royalty the music rights holders get is based on the number of times their songs is being played by users. This can be a profit, as the more popular songs can earn much more.
                        But the criticism lies in the fact that they do not compensate the artists fairly, as smaller or indie labels receive no minimum per stream. We think online access to music is a great way to actually pay the artists for their art instead of illegal downloading.</mark><br><br></dd>
                        <dt id="q6.10">Question 10 - Explain the role of data.gov in the discussion about a more transparent government. What could be a potential danger of sites like data.gov?</dt>
